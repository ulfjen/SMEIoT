This needs to be generated by openapi-generator. `swagger.json` is produced from Web Server. The generated SDK goes to `vendor/smeiot-client`.

On self built openapi-generator, go to the desired directory for sdk. Do `java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -c <path/to/config.json> -i <path/to/swagger.json> -g typescript-fetch`
